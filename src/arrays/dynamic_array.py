Dynamic Array
A dynamic array is an array that resizes itself as needed.What the code does is to create a new array of double the size of the original array and copy the elements from the original array to the new array. This is done when the array is full and a new element needs to be inserted. The new element is then inserted into the new array. The original array is then replaced by the new array. This is done to avoid the overhead of copying elements every time an element is inserted. The new array is created only when the original array is full. This is a common technique used in many programming languages to implement dynamic arrays.
