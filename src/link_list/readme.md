### Linked list

The linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, each element points to the next element in the sequence. It is a linear data structure that is used to store elements. Each element in a linked list is called a node. Each node has two components: data and a reference to the next node in the sequence. The first node is called the head, and the last node is called the tail. The tail node points to null.

There are two types of linked lists: singly linked lists and doubly linked lists. In a singly linked list, each node points to the next node in the sequence. In a doubly linked list, each node points to the next node and the previous node in the sequence.

Linked lists have several advantages over arrays. They can grow and shrink in size dynamically, and they can be easily inserted and deleted. However, linked lists have some disadvantages as well. They have a higher memory overhead than arrays, and they have slower access times because elements are not stored contiguously in memory.

Linked lists are commonly used in computer science and programming. They are used to implement other data structures, such as stacks, queues, and graphs. They are also used in algorithms, such as sorting algorithms and graph traversal algorithms.

Example of a singly linked list in Python:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data=None):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def append(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if self.head is None:
            self.head = new_node
            return
        last_node = self.head
        while last_node.next:
            last_node = last_node.next
        last_node.next = new_node

    def print_list(self):
        cur_node = self.head
        while cur_node:
            print(cur_node.data)
            cur_node = cur_node.next

llist = LinkedList()
llist.append(1)
llist.append(2)

llist.print_list()
```

This code creates a singly linked list with two nodes containing the data values 1 and 2. It then prints the data values of the nodes in the list.

Linked lists are a fundamental data structure in computer science and programming. They are used in a wide variety of applications and are an important concept to understand for any programmer.
